# soundscape

Soundscape is an app that allows users to explore the world through sound!  Soundscape allows the user to record different things they hear (maybe a band, cool conversation or even jsut the wind) and share them with other users by publishing the recording for other users to stumble upon.  While walking, users can also be notified if they stumble upon a previously made recording and through this, can listen to the sounds of the past.  Soundscape is the essential tool for all busy travelers looking for a way to journal their experiences.
